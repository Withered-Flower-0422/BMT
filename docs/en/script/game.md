# Game Script

## Usage

1. Write the script by referring to the writing style of the [Template](#Template) and [Example](#Example).
2. [Import](../advanced/assets#Scripts) the script into the editor.
3. If the script uses [Collision Events](../advanced/item/physicsObject#Collision-Enter) or [Trigger Events](../advanced/item/trigger#Trigger-Event), ensure the item has enabled and properly configured the corresponding components and features.
4. Add the script in the [`Executor`](../advanced/item/executor) component and set up the necessary variables.
5. Enter the game, and the script will execute automatically.

## Hooks

The game provides a total of 6 hooks, see [BST/\_Typings/gameApi/exportFuncs.d.ts](https://github.com/Withered-Flower-0422/BST/blob/main/_Typings/gameApi/exportFuncs.d.ts).

### `init`

```ts
export const init: (self: Item, vars: { [key: string]: any }) => void
```

Executed when the executor loads the script. It executes before all other events and only executes once.

::: warning

Do not perform any operations on in-game objects in this function, because the scene has not finished loading at this point.

:::

- `self`: A reference to the item where the executor component is located.
- `vars`: The variables set on the executor, passed in as key-value pairs.

### `execute`

```ts
export const execute: (...args: any[]) => void
```

Executed when `execute()` is called by another executor in the game.

### `registerEvents`

```ts
export const registerEvents: RegisterEvent[]
```

Exports a string array to register the events it needs to receive.

:::: details Event List

::: warning

All messages passed in events are in the form of an array.
